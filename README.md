# Ubiquant market prediction
The code used to train a few models for Ubiquant's market prediction competition hosted on Kaggle. The models did not perform well on the public leaderboard, but it gave me the opportunity to toy around with some fun model architectures. Also wrote some pytorch dataset classes that could potentially be reused in the future.
